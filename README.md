# Advanced Data Analysis Web Service

## Abstract

The project aims to create a web service using Flask that can display and interact with PDFs. The service will allow users to upload a PDF or provide a link to one, which will then be processed using back-end libraries. The PDF will be displayed in the browser using a front-end library, and users will be able to search, highlight, or annotate the PDF using integrated front-end tools. If annotation or other modifications are made, users will be able to download the modified version of the PDF. Security measures will be put in place to validate the content and prevent malicious uploads.

## Outline

1. **Introduction**
    - Project goal: Create a web service that displays and dynamically interacts with PDFs using Flask.
    - Libraries to research: PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, pdfrw, ReportLab, PDF.js, ViewerJS, pdf-annotate.js.

2. **Back-end Processing**
    - Use Flask with one of the back-end libraries (PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, pdfrw, ReportLab) to process the PDF and extract necessary information.

3. **Front-end Display**
    - Use a front-end library (PDF.js, ViewerJS) to display the PDF in the browser.

4. **Interaction & Annotation**
    - Integrate necessary front-end tools for user interaction.
    - If annotations or other interactions are required, look into pdf-annotate.js.

5. **Save & Download**
    - If annotation or other modifications are made, allow users to download the modified version of the PDF.
    - Use back-end libraries to generate the new version of the PDF.

6. **Security**
    - Consider security when allowing users to upload files.
    - Ensure proper checks are in place to validate the content and prevent malicious uploads.

7. **Conclusion**
    - Summary of recommended libraries for the Flask-based solution.
    - Reminder to always consider security when allowing users to upload files.
